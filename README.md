## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work on milestone 1! Your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case are all clear and descriptive, and your HTML adheres to our style guide well.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- Usually `<p>` and `<ol>` tags are not indented in another level from `<h*>` tags, but it does increase code legibility so I'm going to give you a pass on that.
